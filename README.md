# hello-world
This is my first usage of GitHub to create a new repository!

I have over twentyfive years experience as a corporate programmer.  I have dealt with VB.NET and a LOT of db access.  I use GIT all of the time, using LOCAL resources.  This is my first usage using a remote site with Git...  This looks promising, but I will admit to a bit of a concern with security and access...
